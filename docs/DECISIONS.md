# Frozen decisions

One place to check before proposing something that was already settled. Consolidates the decision tables
that were spread across the earlier French notes. If a decision changes, change it here and say why.

## Product and scope

| Subject | Decision |
| --- | --- |
| Practice screen | A native Tauri window named **Assistant Cabinet AI**, no URL. Not Open WebUI, not a browser |
| Open WebUI | Owner workbench only, English, frozen for the v0 sprint. Never the doctor's screen |
| Open WebUI Computer (`cptr`) | **Never** on a practice machine. Possible evaluation later on a disposable machine |
| Rebadging Open WebUI as our product | Forbidden — its licence does not allow it beyond small use |
| Replacing the practice software | No. Medilink stays alongside, as today |
| Writing into Medilink or sending via MSSanté | **No.** "Export" produces an artefact; she transmits it herself |
| Ameli professional account (sick leave, occupational disease, work accident) | **No** |
| Accounting module | **No.** E-invoicing and the accountant's software stay theirs |
| Certificates (sport, school, sick child, free-form) | **Out** of the first prototype — Medilink templates already suffice |
| Referral letters | Already in Medilink with automatic history. **Not** cloned |
| Biology follow-up banner | **No** — that lives in Medilink and we do not write there |
| Duplicates (MSSanté and paper) | **Yes** — flagged in the plan, local fingerprints, human decision |
| Permanent delete | **No** in v1. Dedicated trash folder only |
| Allow-list equal to all of Documents | **No** — a dedicated work folder subfolder |
| A large model on the 2019 practice PC | **No.** A thin client, yes — otherwise no local file writes are possible |
| Copying patient files onto the Mac mini | **No.** It would become a health-record store |
| Real patient documents | **Not** before a written DPIA draft, a named data controller, and disk encryption |
| Consumer assistants (ChatGPT and similar) for practice files | Closed: forbidden, and the pilot understands why |

## Technology

| Subject | Decision |
| --- | --- |
| Client | Tauri 2 with React and TypeScript. Rust only for native work. Not Electron (fallback only) |
| Server | Python, FastAPI, Pydantic — `apps/server`, the single gateway |
| Inference | Ollama behind the gateway, provider-agnostic through `AIProvider` |
| Server location for v0 | A Mac mini **at the practice**, on her LAN |
| Environment | Docker Compose, the same file on Windows and on the Mac mini |
| Retrieval | On the workstation: SQLite full-text plus vectors, behind a replaceable interface |
| Embeddings | No-store call to the gateway first; local ONNX possible later behind the same interface |
| Scan OCR | Out of v0. Report empty extraction and refuse to classify rather than guess |
| Model choice | Alias allow-list only, licence record mandatory, no clinical-care weights |
| Language | One `locale` variable owned by the client. English prompts in, user's language out |
| Documentation language | English, as of 16 September 2026 |

## Known blind spots to keep in mind

- **File actions are the number one business risk.** A bad batch rename over hundreds of documents is far
  worse than a bad chat sentence. Dry run, manifest, cap, hashes, trash, no permanent delete.
- **Locks.** Word, the antivirus and OneDrive lock or resynchronise files. Handle the failures explicitly
  rather than reporting success.
- **The practice's real naming convention wins.** The AI's "ideal" tree can break the existing filing.
  Collect the pilot's actual convention before writing a `move` tool.
- **Extraction quality decides everything.** Many practice documents are scans. Without good OCR the answers
  lie, so measure the empty-page rate before promising intelligent filing.
- **Concurrency.** A 64 GB Mac mini holds few large contexts at once. Without a queue, timeouts and a fast
  default model, the second user concludes the AI is broken.
- **"Open" weights are not automatically usable in a practice.** Check commercial use, health or legal
  restrictions, and attribution for each one, next to its Ollama name.
- **Shared accounts destroy accountability.** Per-person keys from the first multi-workstation setup.
- **Do not couple the business logic to an agent harness.** The differentiator is the workflow, the plans and
  the audit, not the latest runtime.
- **A failed trial worth remembering.** A French-only filing prompt made the model invent tool calls
  (`rename_file`, `move_file`, `delete_calendar_event`). The fix was English instruction bodies, an explicit
  ban on tool calls, a Markdown-table-only output, and `function_calling: legacy` in `compose.yaml`. This is
  why prompts are English and why file actions live in code rather than in model output.

## Reserved contracts, deliberately not implemented

Voice and mobile are anticipated as contracts only. No implementation before the document pilot holds.

```text
POST /v1/audio/transcriptions   → text  (no-store: no audio kept)
POST /v1/audio/speech           → audio (optional)
POST /v1/jobs                   → { intent, text, bind: "workstation", dry_run }
GET  /v1/jobs/{id}              → status, never document content
```

Rules already frozen for them: cloud speech-to-text and text-to-speech are **forbidden** (local or on-device
only); audio is never retained; a voice command must never trigger `apply` on files, only a draft or a plan
needing visual approval; audio counts as one inference slot; a phone is a remote control and a dictation
device, never a second document store; the mobile surface is a LAN progressive web app, never an app store
release in v1. Handlers return `501` until a dedicated phase.

## Out of scope until the pilot holds

Fine-tuning, mobile applications, a multi-practice hosted service, autonomous overnight operation, a cloud
fallback model on real files, a server-side case index, irreversible actions without review, a second shared
profession, wide-area multi-site access outside a practice VPN.
